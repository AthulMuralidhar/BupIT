    * I want to be able to see the current demand of a subject in real-time. For eg: I teach Physics and Math, 
      if the current demand Math, I must be able to see it.
    * I must be able to demand my pay per hour to the student or get an average pay scale per hour recommeded by the
      website. For eg: I am a new teacher and I do not have any idea how much I should ask for my serves rendered. The website
      could give me suggestions for the average/ optimal pay of the teachers already in the system. For eg2: I am a returning 
      teacher and I have a good reputation and therefore I would like to charge more than the average. This should be possible.
